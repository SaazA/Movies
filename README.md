You can also add the data, by directly add the information about the movie you want to be added.

As i had a time bound of 2 hours, the CSS remains. If i had more time i would have made the page look more interesting, while all the functionalities are working in the app.
All the CRUD Operations made are working.

The API's Defined are:
GET/API/MOVIES - Loads the data dynamically from the Database.
POST/API/MOVIES - Inserts the data to the data database and renders it on the web-page at that very point.
